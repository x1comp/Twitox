Hello, 

This is a Twitter bot written in python using the tweepy API
To use it you'll firstly need to set up a developers account on twitter.
Once your application gets accepted to become a developer account on twitter youll need to create a new project/ app.
Once you do this screenshot or write down the API Access key and the token keys because you will need it later.

Make sure you have python version 3.7 or higher installed on your machine.
You can check by opening the terminal and typing python --v. This should say your version name.
Now your ready to start using the script.

Open the script in your preferred text editor and replace and fill in your API Auth keys and your token keys.
Open your terminal again in administrative mode and type 'pip install tweepy'. Once this task is completed, type 'pip install os' and once this is completely type 'pip install time'.
Now your ready to run the script.

Cd into the directory the script is located at through the terminal, and type 'py tweepybot.py' and it should run the script without having any errors.
If you got any errors while trying to install the packages or running the script make sure pip is set as a system environment variable. 
To do this I recommend watching a YouTube video on how to setup the system environment variable.

Btw I am not responsible for any damage caused by this Twitter bot, 
I do not hold any reliability for this script. Use it at your own risk.
Please don't use this script to harass, bully, threaten or do something stupid. 
Follow the Twitter Tos and behave maturely and orderly while using this script.
